        <H1>Dear Teachers</H1>
        <p> I am very happy that you're my teacher,
            <br>
            I enjoy each lesson you teach,
            <br>
            As my role model you inspire me,
            <br>
            To dream and to work and to reach,
            <br>
            <br>
            With your kindness you get my attention,
            <br>
            Everyday you plant a seed of curiosity and motivation,
            <br>
            To know and to go and succeed,
            <br>
            <br>
            you help me fulfill my potential,
            <br>
            I am thankful for all that you have done,
            <br>
            I admire you each day,
            <br>
            I just want to say,
            <br>
            As a teacher, you're number one.
